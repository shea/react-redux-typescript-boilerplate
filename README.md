# react-redux-typescript-boilerplate

Welcome to the Redux + TypeScript boilerplate.

This project is based on [react-redux-typescript-example](https://github.com/resir014/react-redux-typescript-example)
by Resi Respati, example code for their excellent [post](https://resir014.xyz/posts/2018/07/06/redux-4-plus-typescript/)
on setting up React with Redux and TypeScript.

Does the world need another React / Redux boilerplate? Apparently so, this one uses Typescript!
This is meant as a quick way to get a project started. It uses:

* Redux Saga
* React Router
* Emotion

This project was bootstrapped with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Getting started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:1234
npm start

# build for production
npm run build
```
